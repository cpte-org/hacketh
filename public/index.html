      <p><strong>Protect Your Crypto Wallets:</strong> It is important to take steps to protect your crypto wallets from phishing and other attacks. Always make sure you are on the correct website or app before entering your private keys or seed phrases. Never give your private keys or seed phrases to anyone, and never store them in an unsecured location. Consider using a hardware wallet, such as a Trezor or Ledger device, for added security.</p>
      <p><strong>Autosweep Script:</strong> If you have reason to believe that your wallet's seed phrase has been compromised, you may want to consider using an autosweep script, such as <a href="https://github.com/cpte-org/autosweep">this one</a>. This script periodically attempts to sweep funds from compromised seed phrase wallets, which can help mitigate the effects of an attack.</p>
