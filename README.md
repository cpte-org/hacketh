Hacketh
Hacketh is a website designed to help Ethereum users avoid interacting with compromised addresses, which could be vulnerable to hacks or scams. Users can submit information about addresses that have been compromised, such as through phishing attacks or other forms of unauthorized access. This information is then added to a list that is publicly available on the Hacketh website.

The purpose of this list is to serve as a warning to other Ethereum users. By checking the list before interacting with a new address, users can avoid accidentally sending funds to a compromised address, which could result in the loss of their assets. The goal is to create a safer community for Ethereum users by reducing the risk of hacks and scams.

In addition to the list of compromised addresses, Hacketh also provides resources and information on how to protect oneself from these types of attacks. This includes tips on creating secure passwords, avoiding phishing scams, and using two-factor authentication. By educating users on best practices for staying safe online, Hacketh aims to make the Ethereum community more secure and resilient against attacks.

Overall, Hacketh is a valuable resource for Ethereum users who want to protect their assets and avoid falling victim to scams or hacks. By sharing information about compromised addresses and providing educational resources, Hacketh helps to build a safer and more trustworthy ecosystem for everyone involved in Ethereum.
